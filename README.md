## Data Policy

Large aggregated source datasets are **not** maintained as hand-edited repo source-of-truth files.
Data is generated by importer scripts at build time.

Generated outputs:
- `dist/data/cosmetics.master.json`
- `dist/data/build-report.json`
- `dist/data/cosmetics.master.js`
- `dist/data/build-report.js`

---

## Import Data

```bash
node tools/import-data.mjs
```

Source loading order for vanity/location metadata:
1. `SOURCE_VANITY_URL` / `SOURCE_LOCATIONS_URL` (if set)
2. local `sources/vanity.json` / `sources/locations.json` (gitignored)
3. empty metadata fallback (build still succeeds)

Required public base sources (always fetched):
- `item.json` from pokemmo-hub
- `item-cosmetic.json` from pokemmo-hub

---

## Local Run

```bash
npx serve dist
# or
python -m http.server 8080 --directory dist
```

Open `http://localhost:8080`.

---

## GitHub Pages Deploy

Workflow: `.github/workflows/pages.yml`

- Runs `node tools/import-data.mjs`
- Uploads `dist/` as pages artifact
- Optional repo vars:
  - `SOURCE_VANITY_URL`
  - `SOURCE_LOCATIONS_URL`

If those vars are not configured, deploy uses empty vanity/location metadata.
